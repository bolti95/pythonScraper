If I have one negative reflection on our time at this great venue, it would be in the unacceptable time we spent sitting in Reception waiting - for a number of hours - to be checked into our pre-booked room, and to be informed that the rooms at the Bliss hotel was devoid of refrigerators - something, as a senior Reviewer with TripAdvisor - I have never known in all my twenty years experience of staying at 4 Star rated hotels. However, these points were the only negative aspects of my experience there. The Reception Staff were most professional and so very friendly - especially Rhonda, who made us feel very 'at home' at the Bliss. Young Matthew behind the Reception bar was beneficial to us in helping us to connect to the internet with the Hotel WIFI password. Good work, young man!

When my wife and I got up to our Room on the fourth floor via lift, we immediately realised that this was going to be a lovely quiet hotel to sleep in, fully carpeted floors, and sound-proofing that was of a very high standard - great sleeping at the Bliss.
Our room, 414, was quite spacious, had adequate wardrobe/drawers storage space for our clothes; a large king-sized bed; two comfortable chairs; and a bathroom that was well equipped with toiletries and spotlessly clean. Good work, Batha and the Cleaning Team, you do a wonderful job to keep the guests rooms clean, neat, and tidy. We were also well supplied with tea/coffee and biscuits during our four night stay. Top marks.
Safety from infection seemed to be a real priority at the Bliss, Southport. Every table at breakfast was cleaned and re-laid before being used by hotel guests; and the tables were spaced out to avoid too close contact with others.
Food at the Bliss is really good. We booked breakfast only, but have no doubts whatsoever, that the lunch/dinner meals/conditions were just as nutritious and organised as the breakfast sittings most definitely were. Great work, Bliss Restaurant Staff and Chefs!
All in all, I would fully recommend the Bliss Hotel, Southport as a most credible and enjoyable holiday experience, and would return there in a heartbeat, if the opportunity presents itself again.
Well done, Director James Wood, and all your most professional Staff at the Bliss Hotel, Southport!

Hotel is clean and well run, staff are very good, friendly and professional. We had booked our time for breakfast ahead, COVID restrictions obviously affect the way things operate but it was fairly straightforward and we enjoyed the selection. Excellent sausages! Good soundproofing and comfort beds.Hotel is well situated and the underground car park is a bonus. Will definitely be our first choice for our next trip to Southport. I have given 5 stars as I think it is worth that but I do have some observations. The restaurant area is like a canteen and not a welcoming or comfortable place to eat. It’s OK for breakfast but I wouldn’t want to have dinner there. Reception is on the first floor and the ground floor entrance is basic and on par with entry to a car park at a shopping centre. Outside signage is also basic and little thought seems to have been given to making a good impression. I suggest that management go across the road and look at the hotel objectively. More read less

The view from our room was lovely & we could see over to Blackpool! Our grandsons loved the little robot who brought choc chip cookies for them! We had breakfast which was good with plenty of choice. The only tiny thing were the plastic cups which didn’t match up to the four star rating!! The best thing about this hotel is the staff! They are all very helpful & serve with a smile! Thankyou we will be back soon!!!! read less

We have stayed at The Bliss many times and always been very happy with our room, and enjoyed our stays.
This is our first time staying in The Penthouse! It is absolutely stunning! The panoramic views of the sea, pier, and Marine Lake are fabulous! The Penthouse is elegant and spacious, with a comfortable area to sit and enjoy the view. The lighting, colour scheme, and attention to detail all contribute to making The Penthouse a fabulous place to stay! Thank you to all at The Bliss for a great time! read less

Booked a two night stay at the Bliss Hotel on the spur of the mom... read moreBooked a two night stay at the Bliss Hotel on the spur of the moment, as the weather forecast was sunny. Great, central location, near the pier, lake and shops. Paid £269 for a double room with breakfast, slightly expensive but even the basic hotels in Southport were charging around £200 with breakfast, so not much more, and worth every penny. We loved the hotel, it felt like we were abroad. Lovely room 402, large with full length window views to the side, over the lake, and to the front to town. Toiletries provided in little bottles, and replenished. A kettle was provided with tea, coffee and biscuits, again replenished. Lots of towels and the room very clean. We checked in late the first day so our choice for breakfast was 7.30am or 11.00 am, we opted for 11.00am, but booked 10am for our second day. Arriving at 11.00am, no queue, plenty of items available for a hearty full English, with toast, cereals and preserves. Youghurt available too and pastries (limited as most had gone at earlier sittings). The only slight complaint I had is that at the 11.00am sitting the hot items, were not hot, edible but luke warm. A microwave in the dining room would help. Second day at 10.00am the food was hot. There is a lovely outdoor rooftop area with tables, chairs and a few deck chairs, which overlooks the lake. This area is lit up in the evening and lovely to sit out with drinks. Drink prices OK for beer and cider, although I think £8.00 for a glass of red wine is quite steep. Each and every member of staff was lovely and a credit to the hotel. We parked in the underground car park and all was fine. No charge. Good little bar under pier with live music during the day. All in all we had a fabulous stay and will definitely book this hotel again! read less

Worked hard and noticeably long hours. Hotel in a perfect location with great views. Great lounge bar with a buzzy atmosphere in the evenings. 
Very clean and rooms well equipped. Massive bed in the superior double rooms (although a little hard for my liking, but that's down to personal taste). 
I would love to see a spa and pool put in on the ground floor as it seems to be an empty space, but obviously wouldn't knock a score down for something that doesn't exist! 
A great couple of days in comfortable surroundings. read less

Rooms really comfortable - we had 2 big double beds for 3 of us - lovely shower gel and big fluffy towels. 
Parking is available underground, beneath the hotel and easy to access, but you’ll pay extra per night. 
The breakfast were great - buffet - hot and cold but served to you to help social distancing … plenty of choice and toasty. We ate in the restaurant one night of our stay and booked a table on arrival . Food wasn’t lovely again, and good choice, bar staff and waiting staff really friendly. 
Really recommend - lovey 2 night stay and we found lots to do in Southport and had amazing weather. Great first trip post lockdowns. read less

Staff very helpful and efficient. Breakfast hot and tasty. Toaster excitingly set on fire but soon put out. Live music by the bottom of the pier and at the pub over the road both very good. Park and funfair a very short walk away. Sun shone and a small terrace had some chairs to bask in it. Friendly people, staff, guests and locals. Wished we were there longer. read less

Outstanding Stay What an amazing, modern hotel in an absolutely fantastic location... read moreWhat an amazing, modern hotel in an absolutely fantastic location!

We were lucky enough to stay in the Penthouse Suite for a night at Bliss. The hotel was fantastic from start to finish. All the staff we encountered from the reception, to the bar and the restaurant were all incredibly friendly and welcoming. They made a fuss of our children making them feel relaxed and welcome.

This modern, clean and tidy hotel is child friendly and located on the doorstep of all the main attractions (its right next door to the pier). It has its own carpark located underneath the hotel which is free to use for guests. 

The Penthouse is an amazing room which has its own living area (with feature bath) and separate bedroom area. There is a rainfall shower located in the bathroom as well as the feature bath located in the living room area which makes watching the television in the bath a real novelty. There is also a wraparound balcony with outstanding views of the marine lake and seafront. The room has a large number of floor to ceiling windows making it very light and airy. The aircon had two control points in both the living area and bedroom. 

There were bottled toiletries provided in the bedroom branded as Prija. 

The hotel provided Teepee Jungle type beds for our two children which we believe can be arranged with the hotel for an extra fee. Both our children absolutely loved this experience!

The room and hotel has certainly been decorated to a high and very modern standard. 

Breakfast in the morning is served buffet style and you had to book a slot when checking in which really makes a difference as there were no huge queues to get food. There was a decent offering of both continental and cooked breakfast options. Staff were there to assist and very friendly and flexible to our needs, again a fuss was made of our children. 

We did truly have a magical, relaxing time at The Bliss Hotel and it served as a perfect area to explore Southport including the Pleasureland. 

Overall we were looked after incredibly well and will certainly be returning. We would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Southport. read less

Absolutely stunning, not sure about the bath in the lounge, but it's fabulously big and the shower in the bathroom huge,love the bed so deep and comfy you really don't want to get out. There is underfloor heating and heated towel rail in the bathroom, double doors onto a small 'grassed' balcony overlooking the sea and promenade. We have eaten in quite simply because its good food, excellent service and prices not too bad. We had found going out and getting food very challenging a lot of places understaffed and others only doing snacks.

Once again this hotel has excelled at every level, will definitive returning very soon read less

I will forever be in a debt of gratitude to everyone there, James and every member of the team, for their service, attentive, efficient, bright and welcoming-nothing seems any trouble.There is a sense of family values and a culture of blending casual, unpretentious and fun loving with the atmosphere of a relaxed holiday in a quality environment. 
I am privileged to know of the owners exciting plans and there is the prospect of even greater things to come for them and Southport.
Go stay, visit, work, relax,
celebrate, have fun…..
I “can” recommend it!! read less

The hotel is lovely, the rooms are spacious, very clean and comfortable. The staff are incredibly courteous and friendly. The terrace is lovely with great views. The food was outstanding and very generous portions. We couldn't finish our meal due to the size! Our server Michael has gone above and beyond to arrange for us to take the leftovers to our room to finish later as we hate to see food waste. Michael's service was excellent and very attentive. He even took the time to give us some recommendations of places we could visit next! I would highly recommend staying here and experiencing the hotel. Given the year we've all had; Michael and the rest of the staff have gone above and beyond to give us outstanding customer service and put us at ease. I really look forward to coming back. read less

Very enjoyable stay My husband and I stayed at The Bliss Hotel on Southport for 2 nig... read moreMy husband and I stayed at The Bliss Hotel on Southport for 2 nights last week in a superior room on the 4th floor with a partial lake view. We booked the bed breakfast and dinner rate. The room was lovely with 2 chairs and a table so we could sit by the window and relax with a tea or coffee. The bed was very comfortable and it's the first time I have slept well in any hotel without getting backache. There was plenty of storage space, cooling aircon and the bathroom was fine with an over bath shower. Thankfully there was a grab rail as the bath is deep so it could be tricky getting in and out. I am vegan so was a bit concerned as the vegan food offer in UK hotels is usually dire, not so in The Bliss. They have a 3 course vegan dinner menu with 5 or 6 choices per course. The food was delicious and portions large. I am not a hot breakfast person but was informed by staff that the hash browns, baked beans and tomatoes were suitable for vegans. They had various little boxes of cereal available, pastries for those who don't avoid dairy products, toast, yogurt (including soya yogurt), fruit salad etc. The staff were very polite and helpful and promptly sorted out a couple of issues with bar and restaurant bills. It didn't concern me at all that they were casually dressed and considering the Covid measures which were still in place the service was good. Everywhere was clean with plenty of hand gel available. I quite liked the decor too. I would love to retun and hope that they put fridges back in the rooms at some point as the soya milk I took from home to have in tea quickly went off due to the hot weather. The only slight niggles with the room was common to most hotels...no hook on the back of the bathroom door to hang your toiletries bag and if you want to use your own hair tools the electric socket over the dressing table is too low so I couldn't plug my straighteners in. We will definitely return to this lovely hotel. read less

Beyond exceptional Myself and my wife stayed here in July - dinner bed and breakfast... read moreMyself and my wife stayed here in July - dinner bed and breakfast and I will go as far to say this is one of the best hotels I have stayed in .Every member of staff and we must’ve spoken to a dozen or more were polite and couldn’t do enough for you all in all exceptionally high standards from all the staff. Mid afternoon the weather was nice and we booked a couple of hours on the roof garden terrace and the service from the staff again was great. 
In the evening we had dinner in the hotel & all the dishes we had were great, calamari, steak, chocolate brownie cheeseboard all good . The rooms were nice and clean and we had a view of the marina . After a great night sleep we had breakfast & again great food and service (9am was busy tho’) … it was that good during breakfast we went online and booked ourselves and our friends another overnight at the end of August ….Compliments to all the staff read less

Staff are very professional, pleasant & helpful. We had a superior room on the 5th floor. The room had a lovely lake view & the sea, too, but this doesn’t come too near in Southport! Our room lived up to it’s name - “superior”, with all the usual amenities. This was our first visit here, as previous visits had been to some excellent hotels, now taken over by Britannia which we avoid at all costs!
We will certainly look forward to staying here again. Having booked direct, we had the use of parking for free in the secure car park.
Breakfast are superb, other meals were very good but a little limited as my wife & I are not adventurous in our choices read less

We had a very good comfortable superior room floor 5, excellent views of the lake and Blackpool in the distance. Our break was booked via Secret Escapes and included dinner both evenings, food was of a high quality. Car parking was an extra £10.00 a day and was very convenient. All staff were very friendly and worked very hard. Breakfast was busy but this is due to Covid measures. Thank you to all for a ""Bliss Stay"". read less

Cocktails on the balcony in the deck chairs were very quirky

Smack bang in the middle of Southport we walked to everything. 

Only negative about Bliss was the bed, it was so uncomfortable the pillows were far to fluffy and the mattress too soft I got about 2hrs sleep which wasn't great.

Would still stay again though read less

They have their own car park which is free if you book through hotel. Our room was spotless. Amazing view. Comfy bed. Bathroom spotless and all soaps shampoos etc in a box attached to wall. Made it so much easier. Big fluffy bath sheets. Yes coffee etc. Biscuits. Now on to restaurant all staff so friendly. Food excellent. Just a shout out to Michael usually wears a bandana what a lovely young man. His customer service is excellent nothing too much trouble. Bliss hotel he definitely needs promotion. I am big on customer service and I notice these things. Thankyou to all staff and Michael you will go far. Only one disappointment. When we went to check out different lady on reception. She presented us with our bill I knew it was only for a couple of drinks as I had paid for everything as I went along. She said £100 and something pound I nearly collapsed. Told her that one of the bills wasn’t ours. She was a bit snappy and said well it’s all on your bill. Eventually she realised it was not ours. The least I expected was sorry about that. NOTHING. Think she must have had a bad
Morning. But we had a lovely stay and we will definitely visit again. read less

Discover that Island Feeling!
Welcome to the Islands of Guernsey.
We know many of you love our Islands and have been looking forward to returning. We have been looking forward to seeing you! 
Travel update August 2021
Currently, if you are travelling from the Common Travel Area (UK, the Isle of Man and the Republic of Ireland) and have had both doses of your vaccine, with the second dose being at least 14 days prior to travel, you will be able to arrive with no self-isolation requirements. Fully vaccinated travellers into the Bailiwick will be charged £25 for a pack of five lateral flow tests when they complete the Travel Tracker.
From Monday 16th August any fully vaccinated adult who had their vaccination administered in the Common Travel Area (Guernsey, Jersey, Isle of Man, UK or Republic of Ireland), EU or EFTA (Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein and Switzerland), will be classified as Category 2 if they have travelled anywhere outside of the Common Travel Area in the previous 14 days– as long as they have not spent any time in a country on the UK’s ‘red list’. Read more here
We have produced a handy guide to help you navigate through our most recent travel changes, so please take a look before booking.
In under an hour you could feel free in the Islands of Guernsey. It’s time to unpause your life!
Book your holiday now
We also strongly recommend that visitors arrange to take a pre-travel test (either PCR or lateral flow). Read more here.
If you have not had both your vaccines, or you are travelling via the UK to Guernsey from other destinations around the world, you will have to continue to follow the Categories system we have in place. See which category you are under here.
Before you travel please fill out your Travel Tracker. This can be completed from 48 hours prior to travel. You must also have proof of vaccination. We would recommend downloading the NHS app prior to arriving and also strongly advise people bring the hard copy of their vaccination certificate as well.
